# Python Quiz

Prepare for the Python Quiz, a lively 10-question multiple-choice test designed for Python newcomers! Although we have 30 questions in the database, each quiz session randomly selects 10. If you're teaching Python courses, think about incorporating this quiz to captivate your students and identify areas where they might benefit from some extra assistance. The results are conveniently stored in an external file, allowing for easy visualization through user-friendly spreadsheet functionality. Let's simplify the journey of mastering Python!

For this project, I utilized a [Code Institute template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template), which supplied all the necessary files to enable the mock terminal functionality in the browser.

The questions and options are extracted from the "questions" worksheet, which stores 30 general questions. User history is updated in the "history" worksheet.
